## 📊 Features

- Predicts car resale prices based on user inputs
- Streamlined UI for non-technical users
- Data pre-processing with encoding and type casting
- Scikit-learn pipeline for reproducibility and maintainability

---

## 🧪 Model Training

1. Data cleaned and preprocessed:
   - Categorical columns encoded
   - Converted string-based numbers to numerical types
2. Split into training/testing sets
3. Trained using a regression model (e.g., Linear Regression / Random Forest)
4. Model saved using `joblib`

---

## 🚀 Deployment

The app is built using **Streamlit** and can be run locally or hosted.
